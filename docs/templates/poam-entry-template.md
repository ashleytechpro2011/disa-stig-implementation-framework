### Finding Details

**Finding ID/Vulnerability ID:**  
[e.g., V-220706, Plugin ID 12345, or Assessment Finding #7]

**Finding Title:**  
[Brief descriptive title, e.g., "UAC Virtualization Not Enabled on Clinical Workstations"]

Example:
45 clinical workstations running legacy medical imaging software (MedView v4.2) 
do not have User Account Control (UAC) virtualization enabled as required by 
STIG V-220706. The application requires local administrator privileges and is 
incompatible with UAC virtualization, causing application crashes when the 
setting is enabled.
```

## Risk Assessment

### Severity/Risk Level

**Raw Severity:** [CAT I / CAT II / CAT III] or [Critical / High / Medium / Low]

**Risk Rating:** 

Select using Risk = Likelihood × Impact matrix:

| Likelihood | Impact Low | Impact Moderate | Impact High |
|------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| High       | Moderate   | High            | Very High   |
| Moderate   | Low        | Moderate        | High        |
| Low        | Very Low   | Low             | Moderate    |

**Selected Risk Level:** [Very High / High / Moderate / Low / Very Low]

### Likelihood Assessment

**Likelihood:** [High / Moderate / Low]

**Justification:**
```
[Explain factors that increase or decrease likelihood of exploitation]

Example:
MODERATE Likelihood

Increasing factors:
- 45 systems affected increases attack surface
- Healthcare sector is high-value ransomware target
- Application processes external data from multiple sources

Decreasing factors:
- Systems on isolated VLAN with restricted network access
- Limited internet connectivity
- No current known vulnerabilities in application
```

### Impact Assessment

**Confidentiality Impact:** [High / Moderate / Low / N/A]  
**Integrity Impact:** [High / Moderate / Low / N/A]  
**Availability Impact:** [High / Moderate / Low / N/A]

**Overall Impact:** [High / Moderate / Low]

**Impact Justification:**
```
[Explain the potential consequences if this vulnerability were exploited]

Example:
HIGH Impact

Confidentiality: HIGH - System contains Protected Health Information (PHI) for 
~10,000 patients. Compromise would result in HIPAA breach notification requirement.

Integrity: HIGH - Attacker with local admin could modify patient imaging data, 
potentially affecting medical diagnoses and treatment decisions.

Availability: MODERATE - Could disrupt emergency department imaging services, 
impacting patient care but backup manual processes exist.
```

## Notes and Lessons Learned

### Implementation Challenges

```
[Document any challenges encountered during remediation]

Example:
- Initial vendor estimate for delivery was 4 weeks but actual was 9 weeks due to 
  supply chain delays
- User acceptance testing revealed need for additional workflow modifications not 
  identified in initial analysis
- Weekend maintenance windows proved insufficient; required 3 overnight deployments
```

### Best Practices Identified

```
[Document successful approaches that could be applied to future POA&Ms]

Example:
- Early engagement with clinical staff during planning phase reduced resistance 
  to change
- Phased deployment approach (10 systems first) identified issues before full rollout
- Maintaining compensating controls until full remediation verified prevented 
  security gaps
```

### Recommendations for Future

```
[Suggestions for avoiding similar issues in the future]

Example:
- Include application UAC compatibility in procurement requirements for all new 
  software purchases
- Maintain test environment that mirrors production for STIG testing
- Build 30-day buffer into vendor delivery timelines
- Conduct quarterly reviews of legacy application inventory to identify future 
  upgrade requirements before they become compliance issues
